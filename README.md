# Prolog
The prolog code attempts to navigate through a maze using predefined facts. Rules and recursive rules are used to
accurately navigate through the maze and shows all possible paths to reach from A to B. If no path is found then nothing
is outputted. Checks are done during the query to prevent endless loops using a list which contains all visited nodes.
# Flex
An interface appears that gives a multiple choice list to choose from, each option chosen affects the output. 
A forward chaining and backward chaining program example has been given.
